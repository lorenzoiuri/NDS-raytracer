# NDS-raytracer
Testing a simple NDS raytracing implementation

Using NDSlib from DevKitPro

* **part1** Shows how to insersect a ray with a sphere and how to put the color data into the VRAM accordingly.
* **part2** Sdds the computation of the distance of intersection, the point of the intersection and the normal of the point. These data are stored in a hitrecord and used to color the surface of the sphere using the normal of the points.
